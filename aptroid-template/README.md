# Aptroid Hiring Template

Standalone, editable HTML/CSS version of the "We're Hiring" flyer for Aptroid Consulting. This lives outside the MailTo app so you can manage it as an independent repo or drop it onto any static host.

## Structure

- `index.html` – semantic markup mirroring the JPG layout
- `styles.css` – gradient hero, cards, CTA, and responsive tweaks

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser or editor with live preview.
2. Update copy directly in the markup. Each section has its own `<section>` block.
3. Adjust styling in `styles.css` (colors, spacing, fonts) as needed.
4. When finished, zip the folder or initialize a new git repo from `aptroid-template/`.

## Notes

- Fonts use Google Fonts (`Inter`). Replace or self-host if required.
- Designed to export cleanly to PNG/PDF if you print to file from the browser at 100% scale.
- The layout is mobile-friendly; shrink the viewport to confirm responsive behavior.
